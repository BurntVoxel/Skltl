				<h1> Skltl library </h1>
	            <h2> A bare-bones web framework. </h2>
				<p> 
					What do you get when a web developer who likes doing everything from scratch
					collects every line of code that shows up in every single project he writes?
					<br> This. This is what you get. 
				</p>
			</section>
				<h2>Why</h2>
				<p>
					Trying to define the principles of what Skltl is 
					would take more time than reimplementing all this code (for the 50th time),
					so I'll keep the goals brief.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Modular design: Each file has one job. Sometimes the files with 
						complicated jobs are shockingly short (such as toggle-hide buttons 
						that I use to make menus), and sometimes simple jobs are shockingly verbose 
						(such as color theme palettes).
					</li>
					<li>
						Minimal starting knowledge: This thing uses as few custom classes and 
						IDs as possible. You can just plunk this CSS on any clean semantic 
						HTML and it should look just fine.
					</li>
					<li>
						Hackable: If it isn't obvious where to find the variable to tweak this 
						property or that, I haven't done my job right.
					</li>
					<li>
						Skinnable: Variables are awesome. It's super easy to redo the theme for 
						a website only a few tweaks.
					</li>
					<li>
						Extensible: Any code I decide I'll reuse a lot is easy to just slot in. 
						<code>@import</code> just might be the most useful CSS feature ever, 
						unless someone patches in color mixing soon.
						<br><sub><em><del>*cough cough <code> background="rgb(var(--back),50%); </code> cough*</del></em></sub>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<section>
				<h2> Features </h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Script to compile modular CSS with extensive imports into a single file. </li>
					<li> Built-in auto dark/light theme preference matching. </li>
					<li> Noscript-friendly toggle-hide buttons for menus. </li>
					<li> Responsive: Wide screens get two sidebars, narrow screens get vertical layout. </li>
					<li> Content that you'd expect to be blocks are actually blocks now. </li>
					<li> It's easy to make certain block content into inline. </li>					
					<li> Inline pics and SVG are sized and positioned to fit in like custom emojis. </li>
					<li> Navigation menus are intuitive to make now. </li>
				</ul>
